Section 1 - EDITING THE CONFIG FILE                         Updated 2015-09-22
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The arch/arm/configs/mapphone_mmi_defconfig file in this kernel includes a special
section called "JooJooBee666 special flags" located at around line 60.  To
enable an option, remove the "#" at the beginning of the line and add "=y" to
the end (reference other options in the config file).

Below are the meanings of each of these options:

CONFIG_USE_FREQ_REDUC_MOD - Removes frequencies between 300 and 1000
CONFIG_USE_13_CLOCK - Add 1.3Ghz clock frequency
CONFIG_USE_14_CLOCK - Add 1.4Ghz clock frequency
CONFIG_USE_MULTI_FREQ - Add 100Mhz stepping from 300 to 1200
CONFIG_USE_ULV_VOLTAGE - Sets voltage for 1.4Ghz frequency to 1.409
CONFIG_USE_HIGH_VOLTAGE - Sets voltage for 1.4Ghz to 1.439

The default voltage to 1.4Ghz is 1.415. If this is what you want, REM out the above voltage lines as such:
#CONFIG_USE_ULV_VOLTAGE=y
#CONFIG_USE_HIGH_VOLTAGE=y

If you leave both enabled, the ULV voltage will be the one ultimately selected
during build so be careful.


Section 2 - BUILDING THE KERNEL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build this on your own follow these steps:

1.  Copy the bkernel.sh to the root of your CM-12.1 build folder.
    
2.  Edit your /.repo/local_manifests/ and replace the following line:
    <project name="CyanogenMod/android_kernel_motorola_omap4-common" path="kernel/motorola/omap4-common-source" remote="github" />
    with this line:
    <project name="JooJooBee666/android_kernel_motorola_omap4-common" path="kernel/motorola/omap4-common" remote="github" />
    This will now configure your build folder to sync the kernel source to 
    this repo.

3.  Edit the options in the kernel arch/arm/configs/mapphone_mmi_defconfig.  See
    section 2 above for details.

4.  Edit the bkernel.sh script and set the buildHome path at the top of the file
    to the root of the path of your CM12.1 repo.

5.  From bash, go to the root of your CM12.1 build folder and run the bkernel.sh
    script.

6.  Name the script as you see fit.

7.  When completed, the script will place the ready to flash zip file in the out
    folder.  Once completed, the script will show you the name of the file it created
    so you can easily locate it.


8.  Flash it and pray.
